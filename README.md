# KMeans Clustering Model

This repository contains the implementation of a KMeans Clustering model for customer segmentation. The model is trained using the Mall Customers dataset to group customers based on their annual income and spending score.

## Model Overview

- **Objective**: To segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior.
- **Dataset**: Mall Customers Dataset (from the Kaggle website, I saved in my repo)
- **Algorithm Used**: KMeans Clustering
- **Features Used**: Annual Income (in thousands) and Spending Score (1-100)

## Files in the Repository

- **KMeansClustering.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for training and evaluating the KMeans Clustering model.
- **Mall_Customers.csv**: Dataset used for training the model.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the repository and instructions for running the code.

## Instructions for Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/muthumeenal12/PRODIGY_ML_02.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have the required Python packages installed. You can install them using:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook**: Open and run the `KMeansClustering.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or any compatible environment. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to train the model, visualize the clusters, and interpret the results.

## Results

- The KMeans Clustering model successfully segments customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior.
- Visualizations are provided to understand the characteristics of each cluster and interpret the results effectively.

## Further Improvements

- Experiment with different clustering algorithms and hyperparameters to improve clustering performance.
- Explore additional features or datasets to enhance customer segmentation and derive deeper insights.
